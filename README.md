# Pokemon Retirement Index
With the price of pokemon cards skyrocketing over the past couple years, I wanted to create an all-in-one hub that can quicky show you the market price range for each pokemon card. Prices and images are generated from the Pokemon TCG API and you will be directed to eBay where you can you see the resell prices for each individual card.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

The magic from this project all comes from the Pokemon TCG API. All the cards, card info and prices and pulled from the API and then all the info is pushed to an array that dynamically gets created in JS and has Bootstrap styling. 


## Lessons Learned:

I really got a chance to see the power of using a framework like Bootstrap and how it can really put a nice touch to a site. There were some tricky little bumps along the way in regards of gathering the correct card prices from the API to ensure all prices searched on ebay were the correct type.
